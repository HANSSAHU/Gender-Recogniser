# Gender-Recogniser

This application uses machine learning models to predict the gender of a person from an image of their face. It utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction.

Models
SVM Model: Trained on a dataset of labeled facial images to classify gender.
PCA: Used for feature extraction to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
Dataset
The SVM model was trained on a dataset of facial images with corresponding gender labels. The dataset is not included in this repository.
